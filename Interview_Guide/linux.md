## 1️⃣ What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is software that acts as a **bridge between the user and the hardware**. 
It manages system resources like CPU, memory, storage, and devices, and allows us to run applications.

Examples are **Linux, Windows, and macOS**.

---

## 2️⃣ Difference Between Linux and Windows

Linux is **open-source and customizable**, while Windows is **commercial and user-friendly**.
